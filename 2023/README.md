# Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1

I use a list of strings with the names of the digits to search digits spelled in letters:

**["zero","one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]**

I started with "zero", even if the specification only requires digits 1 to 9: since the indexing of a list starts at 0, it makes it easy to get the right value.
