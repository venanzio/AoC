# Advent of Code

I've been solving the Advent of Code puzzles in the last two years:
  https://adventofcode.com/

I originally solve them in Haskell, as quickly as I can.
Then I go over them again and try to come up with better solutions.
I also use AoC to lear new programming languages.

In the folders you'll find my original *quick* solutions in Haskell, the better *slow* solutions, still in Haskell, and the solutions in a different programming language.
