## Solutions in Haskell

*haskell_quick* contains the solutions I wrote when I did the puzzles on the day they were released.

*haskell_slow* contains revised solutions, where I tried to improve programming style and efficiency.

## Solutions in Python

I used AoC to learn some Python and put my solutions in the *python* directory.
